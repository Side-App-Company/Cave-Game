* About this folder...
*   - Top level folder for all UI materials.
*     - i.e. Buttons, forms, loaders, etc.
*   - All material files should be placed in their respective folders.

* WARNING!!!
*   - Unity makes duplicate copies of the default material if you don't manually set a new default.
*     - This creates extra overhead in memory across addressable files.
*   - ALWAYS set a material even if it's just our own copy of the default material.
